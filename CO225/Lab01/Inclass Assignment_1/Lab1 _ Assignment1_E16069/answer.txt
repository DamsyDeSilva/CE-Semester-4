attendance percentage of a student = (sum of attendace of the student)*100/45;

average percentage of all the students (M) = (sum of all attendance of all students)*100/(45*61);

For M to be exactly 50%, 
sum of all attendance of all students = 1372.5
Since the attendance couldn't be a fractional number : the percentage of all the students couldn't be 50%.
